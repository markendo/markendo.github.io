<main>
<p>My research interest lies in developing deep learning solutions to aid decision making in settings such as medicine. I first got into AI research because I wanted to apply my background of music technology and music production to help develop a system that screens for COVID-19 using the sound of someone’s cough. From that experience, I saw how AI solutions have the potential to immensely impact people’s lives. At the same time, I realized the potential dangers that AI systems can have, especially if there is a lot of trust put into them. This year, I worked on medical imaging vision models in radiology to help establish clinician trust. I hope to tackle high-impact problems and develop vision systems to better people’s lives.</p>
