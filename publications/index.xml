      <description>Abstract: Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a neurological disorder that has a variety of observable motor-related symptoms such as slow movement, tremor, muscular rigidity, and impaired posture. PD is typically diagnosed by evaluating the severity of motor impairments according to scoring systems such as the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). Automated severity prediction using video recordings of individuals provides a promising route for non-intrusive monitoring of motor impairments.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Based Chest X-Ray Report Generation Using a Pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Model</title>

      <description>Abstract: We propose CXR-RePaiR: a retrieval-based radiology report generation approach using a pre-trained contrastive language-image model. Our method generates clinically accurate reports on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. CXR-RePaiR outperforms or matches prior report generation methods on clinical metrics, achieving an average F1 score of 0.352 (Î”+7.98%) on an external radiology dataset (CheXpert). Further, we implement a compression approach used to reduce the size of the reference corpus and speed up the runtime of our retrieval method.</description>

      <title>CheXseg: Combining Expert Annotations with DNN-generated Saliency Maps for X-ray Segmentation</title>

      <description>Abstract: Medical image segmentation models are typically supervised by expert annotations at the pixel-level, which can be expensive to acquire. In this work, we propose a method that combines the high quality of pixel-level expert annotations with the scale of coarse DNN-generated saliency maps for training multi-label semantic segmentation models. We demonstrate the application of our semi-supervised method, which we call CheXseg, on multi-label chest X-ray interpretation. We find that CheXseg improves upon the performance (mIoU) of fully-supervised methods that use only pixel-level expert annotations by 9.</description>
